ElivsPy
====

ElvisPy is an configuration management tool that works as an extra layer over Fabric, that abstract some common tasks as python functions (resources) so to avoid writting static strings.

In future it would be cool to have other things like variable reading from json files so roles, environments and nodes can be defined.

#### TODO
These resources are missing

 * user
 * group
 * service
 * apt_package
 * chmod chown
 * mount
 * file
 * cron
 * bash
 * execute
 * tar, zip
